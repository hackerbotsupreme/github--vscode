what is the main usage difference between section and div tag in html  
ChatGPT
Both <section> and <div> tags are used to group and structure content in HTML, but they have different semantic meanings and intended uses.

The <section> tag is used to define a section or grouping of related content within a document. It represents a thematic grouping of content, such as chapters in a book, articles in a magazine, or different sections of a web page. A <section> should have a heading (e.g. <h1>, <h2>, etc.) that describes the theme or topic of the section.

On the other hand, the <div> tag is a generic container element that is used to group together other HTML elements and apply styling or scripting to them as a unit. It has no semantic meaning of its own, and is typically used to create a block-level container for styling or scripting purposes. A <div> can contain any other HTML elements, including other <div> elements.

In short, the main difference between <section> and <div> is that <section> is used for grouping related content that has a thematic relationship, while <div> is used for grouping arbitrary content that needs to be styled or scripted as a unit.
